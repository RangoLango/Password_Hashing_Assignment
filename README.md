# Password_Hashing_Assignment
I have written my test cases based on the requirements listed in the specifications. I try to breakdown test cases into the smallest pieces I can. I believe test cases should only have one reason for failing. This allows the QA person to report what is wrong as specifically as they can.

An example would be if I wrote a large case for all requirements in sending a POST for hashing the password. If all requirements listed for that call were one big case, then the test case would have failed for several reasons. The way I broke down the requirements into several test cases allows me to more accurately report my findings and makes it much easier for Devs to fix. The main issue is the malformed input response, and due to that, I am blocked in being able to test the other requirements. This allows me to more accurately report the other requirements as blocked and not as failures.

If this was a real world situation, I would also build a Confluence page (or something similar) detailing the installation process and curl commands used. 

I'mn not sure what I am doing that is causing the user error response of Malformed Input. If I were part of the team, I would reach out for help. I have spent a bit of time trying to search and see what I'm doing wrong, but nothing I've found is helping to resolve the issue. I am using the command as given in the instructions and would expect the information provided to work. 

Hopefully my lack of experience using PowerShell and curl won't detract from my overall QA experience and attention to detail. I would love an opportunity to learn more and be a part of the team.

Overall this assignment was a good challenge for me, and I learned things that I didnâ€™t know before. I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to hearing your feedback soon.
